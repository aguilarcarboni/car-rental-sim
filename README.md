# Red Raider Car Rental

## Operating Systems
### Description 
A Java-based distributed car rental management system that demonstrates operating system concepts through the management of vehicle lots and rental shops.

- Rental Shop for customer-facing operations
- File system for data persistence
- Transaction tracking system
- Command-line interface for operations

### Learning Objectives
- Understanding memory management techniques
- Implementing file-based persistence
- Managing concurrent operations
